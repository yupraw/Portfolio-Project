## Financial Analysis
**Revenue and Profitability**
- Total Revenue: Increased by approximately 71% over the year, indicating strong market demand and successful business strategies.
- EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation): Significant increase driven by improved gross margins and revenue growth. This has resulted in a substantial rise in net profit before tax.
- Net Interest Expense: Almost halved due to a drop-in interest expense and an increase in interest income, positively impacting net profitability.
- Net Profit Before Tax: Increased in line with the rise in EBITDA, reflecting overall financial health and profitability.
  
**Assets and Liabilities**
- Total Assets: Balance sheet expanded ~19% YoY basis, and is primarily dominated by PPE (~50%) which is in line with manufacturer model.
- Total Tangible Assets: Similarly, a slight increase, maintaining the company's asset base.
- Inventory: A sizable 40% increase in inventory during 2023 aligns with the revenue growth, ensuring adequate stock levels to meet demand.
- Cash and Cash Equivalents: Cash reserves reduced YoY primarily to support capital expenditure on investments & debt repayments. This needs monitoring to ensure liquidity.
- Total Liabilities: Slight increase, manageable within the context of overall growth.
- Net Worth: Increased by approximately 33%, reflecting improved shareholder value.
- Tangible Net Worth: Similarly increased by around 34%, indicating a solid financial foundation.
  
**Cash Flow**
- Operating Cash Flow: Almost doubled, demonstrating strong cash generation from core activities.
- Capital Expenditure: Increased due to investments in property and equipment, supporting long-term growth.
- Free Cash Flow: Increased due to higher operating cash flows, partially offset by increased capital expenditure, indicating healthy financial management.

## Key Financial Ratios

**Profitability Ratios**
- EBITDA Margin: Almost doubled, indicating enhanced profitability.
- Operating Margin: Similarly doubled, reflecting improved operational efficiency.
  
**Leverage and Liquidity Ratios**
- Interest Coverage Ratio: Significant improvement due to increased EBITDA and reduced net interest payments, enhancing financial stability.
- Current Asset Ratio: Slightly dropped, suggesting a need to monitor liquidity closely.
- Leverage Metric: Decreased by approximately 6.6 (84%), mainly due to increased EBITDA, indicating reduced financial risk.
- Net Leverage: Increased by approximately 3.2 (62%), driven by the leverage metric improvement but offset by reduced cash balance.
- Cash Flow/ Capital Expenditure Ratio: Changed by 0.4 due to higher capital expenditure relative to cash flows from operating activities, suggesting cautious investment strategies.
  
**Risk Assessment**

**Key Financial Risks**
1.	Liquidity Risk: The slight drop in cash and cash equivalents and current asset ratio requires close monitoring to ensure the company can meet its short-term obligations.
2.	Capital Expenditure Risk: While increased capital expenditure supports growth, it also strains free cash flow. Ensuring a balance between investment and liquidity is crucial.
3.	Leverage Risk: Although the leverage metric has improved significantly, the increase in net leverage due to a decrease in cash balance poses a potential risk.
4.	Inventory Risk: The substantial increase in inventory must be managed efficiently to prevent overstocking and related costs.
Actionable Insights
1.	Enhance Liquidity Management: Implement strategies to improve cash reserves and optimize current asset management.
2.	Monitor Capital Expenditure: Ensure that capital investments are aligned with cash flow capabilities to maintain financial stability.
3.	Leverage Optimization: Continue to focus on reducing leverage by increasing profitability and maintaining a healthy cash balance.
4.	Efficient Inventory Management: Streamline inventory processes to align with sales growth and minimize holding costs.


## Conclusion
Green Solutions Manufacturing Ltd demonstrates strong financial health with significant revenue growth, improved profitability, and a solid asset base. However, attention to liquidity, capital expenditure, and leverage management is essential to mitigate potential risks. The company is well-positioned for continued success, provided these financial strategies are effectively implemented.
